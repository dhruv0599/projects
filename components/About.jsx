        <h2>👨‍💻 About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Dhruv, a passionate front-end developer with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I love solving real-world problems through code and constantly strive to improve my skills through trial and error. My learning style is practical—I dive into bugs, errors, and issues to understand the core concepts deeply.
          I'm especially interested in building responsive user interfaces and exploring the logic behind dynamic web applications. Besides coding, I enjoy working on data-driven tasks with Excel and learning how technology can make life more efficient.
          Currently, I’m focused on sharpening my React skills, including routing and component architecture. My goal is to create seamless and user-friendly digital experiences.
